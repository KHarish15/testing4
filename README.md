# Automated Testing Setup

This repository has been automatically configured with GitHub Actions for continuous testing.

## Setup Instructions

## Integrating GitHub Actions with KHarish15/testing4

This document outlines the steps to integrate GitHub Actions for automated testing of the Python project `testing4`.

**1. Adding the Workflow File:**

Create a file named `.github/workflows/main.yml` in your repository.  This file will define the workflow.

```yaml
name: Python Tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # or any branch you want to trigger tests on
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.9'  # Or your desired Python version
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install pytest
    - name: Run tests
      run: pytest
```

**2. Required Environment Variables:**

This project doesn't require any environment variables.

**3. Dependencies to Install:**

The `pytest` library is needed.  This will be handled by the workflow.

**4. Configuring the Test Framework (Pytest):**

The provided `.github/workflows/main.yml` file automatically installs pytest and runs the tests (`pytest`). Ensure your test file (`test_main.py`) is correctly importing your code modules and that your test functions are following pytest naming conventions.


**5. Viewing Test Results:**

The GitHub Actions workflow will display the results of the tests directly in the Actions tab of the GitHub repository.  A green check mark signifies successful tests, while a red cross shows failures.  Click on the "build" job for detailed test logs, including output from `pytest`.  You can see the failed test cases and error messages.

**6. Troubleshooting Common Issues:**

* **Tests fail with `ModuleNotFoundError`:**  Double-check that the `test_main.py` file correctly imports functions from `main.py`. Ensure there are no typos in the import statements.  Also, verify that the `main.py` and `test_main.py` files are in the same directory or adjust import paths if necessary.

* **Tests fail with `ImportError`:** If you have external dependencies (rare in this case), ensure they are listed in `requirements.txt` (create one if needed) and install them. The workflow now handles this using `pip install pytest`.

* **Python version incompatibility:** Ensure the `python-version` in the `actions/setup-python` step matches the Python version your project is built with.

* **Permission errors:**  If you encounter errors about permissions, verify your workflow's permissions to access the repository.



**7. Project-Specific Configuration Steps:**

This is a very basic project.  Further configuration is not needed.  The steps outlined in the workflow file should cover all requirements.

**Example `main.py`:**

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

def divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return a / b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

def is_even(n):
    return n % 2 == 0

def get_max(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Empty list provided")
    return max(numbers)
```

**Example `test_main.py`:**

```python
import pytest
from main import add, subtract, divide, multiply, is_even, get_max

def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0

def test_subtract():
    assert subtract(10, 5) == 5
    assert subtract(5, 10) == -5

def test_divide():
  assert divide(10, 2) == 5
  with pytest.raises(ValueError):
      divide(10, 0)
```

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate GitHub Actions for automated testing in your `testing4` project. Remember to commit and push the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file to your repository to activate the workflow.

## Security Note

The GitHub token used for this setup should have the minimum required permissions:
- `repo` scope for private repositories
- `public_repo` scope for public repositories
- Write access to the repository

For security, consider using GitHub Apps or fine-grained personal access tokens.
